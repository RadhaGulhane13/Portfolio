- Designed and developed state-of-the-art persistent B+ tree to optimize the object storage engine used by CORTX (an open-source, cloud-distributed storage) [codebase](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/blob/main/be/btree.c)
- Assisted memory limit feature to reduce primary memory consumption from 95% to acceptable levels in absence of swap space
- Implemented various node formats for variable-sized objects with CRC (Cyclic redundancy check) support for data recovery
- Achieved performance improvement of up to 30% read and 10% write object in case of direct addressing (i.e., the object will reside in node) and 60% read object for indirect addressing (i.e., the node will hold the address of object)
