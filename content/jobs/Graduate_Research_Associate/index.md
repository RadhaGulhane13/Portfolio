- Implemented [MPI4DL](https://github.com/OSU-Nowlab/MPI4DL), Distributed Deep Learning models to train denser models with high-resolution images
  <!-- - Enabled training of ResNet and AmoebaNet for up to 2048 * 2048 image sizes with 0.76 and 2.96 throughput, respectively -->
  <!-- - Exploiting the Cerebras CS-2 Systems (AI Accelerators) to train a high-resolution digital pathology image dataset -->
- Enabled training of out-of-core ResNet and AmoebaNet models for 8K and 16K image sizes
- Accelerated inference by 5x for Single Node DL, and by 2x for Distributed DL for high-resolution images utilizing Quantization
