The objective is to apply clustering techniques to three distinct datasets : [small_Xydf](https://github.com/RadhaGulhane13/clustering-algorithm/blob/main/small_Xydf.csv), [large1_Xydf](https://github.com/RadhaGulhane13/clustering-algorithm/blob/main/large1_Xydf.csv), [large2_Xydf](https://github.com/RadhaGulhane13/clustering-algorithm/blob/main/large2_Xydf.csv). Subsequently, evaluate the effectiveness of various clustering algorithms on these datasets and compare their performance to determine the most suitable algorithm.
