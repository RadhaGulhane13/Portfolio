Implemented Data Parallelism using Horovod for PyTorch Distributed and PyTorch distributed for the ResNet model. Also, conducted performance evaluations for both weak and strong scaling by varying the number of nodes. The objective was to identify the optimal configuration that offers the best performance in terms of scalability and efficiency.
