This project finds association rules in transaction data to improve store revenue. By discounting a product by 10% monthly, it aims to increase its purchase frequency by 5% and drive sales of other non-discounted products. The focus is on selecting two-item rules (A -> B) with the highest revenue impact based on support, confidence, and other metrics.
